## S_MotionDetect

For each frame, finds the difference between the frame and
a frame before it.

In the Sapphire Time effects submenu.

### Inputs:

- **Source**: The current layer. The clip to be processed.

- **Mask**: Defaults to None. Interpolate between the result and the Source input. White areas use the result of the effect. Black areas use the Source clip.


### Parameters:

- **Load Preset** (Push-button)
  Brings up the Preset Browser to browse all available presets for this effect.

- **Save Preset** (Push-button)
  Brings up the Preset Save dialog to save a preset for this effect.

- **Mocha Project** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  Brings up the Mocha window for tracking footage and generating masks.

- **Blur Mocha** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  Blurs the Mocha Mask by this amount before using. This can be used to soften the edges or quantization artifacts of the mask, and smooth out the time displacements.

- **Mocha Opacity** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 1)
  Controls the strength of the Mocha mask. Lower values reduce the intensity of the effect.

- **Invert Mocha** (Check-box, Default: off)
  If enabled, the black and white of the Mocha Mask are inverted before applying the effect.

- **Resize Mocha** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  Scales the Mocha Mask. 1.0 is the original size.

- **Resize Rel X** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  The relative horizontal size of the Mocha Mask.

- **Resize Rel Y** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  The relative vertical size of the Mocha Mask.

- **Shift Mocha** (X & Y, Default: [0 0], Range: any)
  Offsets the position of the Mocha Mask.

- **Dilate Mocha** (Default: 0, Range: -100 to 100)
  Dilates or erodes the Mocha Mask by this pixel amount before using.

- **Dilation Quality** (Popup menu, Default: Fast)
  Selects whether Dilate Mocha adusts quickly in default Fast mode or looks better in High quality mode.
  - **Fast**: Dilate Mocha in Fast mode for quick adjustments.
  - **High**: Dilate Mocha in High quality mode for a better looking mask shape.

- **Bypass Mocha** (Check-box, Default: off)
  Ignore the Mocha Mask and apply the effect to the entire source clip.

- **Show Mocha Only** (Check-box, Default: off)
  Bypass the effect and show the Mocha Mask itself.

- **Combine Masks** (Popup menu, Default: Union)
  Determines how to combine the Mocha Mask and Input Mask when both are supplied to the effect.
  - **Union**: Uses the area covered by both masks together.
  - **Intersect**: Uses the area that overlaps between the two masks.
  - **Mocha Only**: Ignore the Input Mask and only use the
Mocha Mask.

- **Delay Frames** (Integer, Default: 1, Range: any)
  The number of frames back to get the previous frame which is compared to the current frame.

- **Brightness** (Default: 1, Range: 0 or greater)
  Scales the brightness of the motion image.

- **Offset Darks** (Default: 0, Range: -8 to 2)
  Adds this gray value to the darker regions of the motion image. This can be negative to increase contrast.

- **Saturation** (Default: 1, Range: -2 to 10)
  Scales the color saturation of the motion image. Increase for more intense colors. Set to 0 for monochrome.

- **Motion** (Popup menu, Default: All)
  Selects between different motion types to detect.
  - **All**: shows all motion, both increasing and decreasing brightness levels.
  - **Brighter**: shows only motion in which the brightness is increasing, for
example the leading edge of an object moving over a darker background.
  - **Darker**: shows only motion in which the brightness is decreasing, for
example the trailing edge of an object moving over a darker background.

- **Combine** (Popup menu, Default: Motion Only)
  Determines how the motion image is combined with the original source.
  - **Motion Only**: gives the motion alone.
  - **Mult**: the motion is multiplied by the source.
  - **Add**: the motion is added to the source.
  - **Screen**: the motion is blended with the source using a
screen operation.
  - **Difference**: the result is the difference between the motion
and source.
  - **Overlay**: combines the motion and source using an overlay function.
  - **Subtract**: subtracts the motion image from the source darkening those areas.

- **Input Opacity** (Popup menu, Default: Normal)
  Determines the method used for dealing with opacity/transparency.
  - **All Opaque**: Use this option to render slightly faster when
the input image is fully opaque with no transparency (alpha=1).
  - **Normal**: Process opacity normally.
  - **As Premult**: Process as if the image is already in
premultiplied form (colors have been scaled by opacity). This option
also renders slightly faster than Normal mode, but the results will
also be in premultiplied form, which is sometimes less correct.

- **Output Opacity** (Popup menu, Default: All Opaque)
  Determines the opacity/transparency of the result. This effect does not process the opacity (alpha channel) of its input but it can either copy the opacity from the input, or output a fully opaque result.
  - **All Opaque**: Makes the result fully opaque with no
transparency.
  - **Copy From Input**: Copies the opacity/transparency from
the current layer given to this effect.

- **Mask Use** (Popup menu, Default: Luma)
  Determines how the Mask input channels are used to make a monochrome mask.
  - **Luma**: the luminance of the RGB channels is used.
  - **Alpha**: only the Alpha channel is used.

- **Blur Mask** (Default: 0.05, Range: 0 or greater)
  Blurs the Matte input by this amount before using. This can provide a smoother transition between the matted and unmatted areas. It has no effect unless the Matte input is provided.

- **Invert Mask** (Check-box, Default: off)
  If on, inverts the Matte input so the effect is applied to areas where the Matte is black instead of white. This has no effect unless the Matte input is provided.
