## S_TileScramble

Breaks the image into rectangular tiles and shifts
the image within each tile to create an effect like a wall of small
randomly oriented mirrors reflecting the source image. The amount
and direction of shifting are controllable.

In the Sapphire Stylize effects submenu.

### Inputs:

- **Source**: The current layer. The input clip to be warped.

- **Matte**: Defaults to None. If provided, the amplitude of warping is scaled by the values of this input clip. Gray values internally scale the warping amplitude rather than simply cross-fading between the effect and the original source to allow more continuous results at the matte edges and more detailed control over the warping amounts. This input can be affected using the Blur Matte, Invert Matte, or Matte Use parameters.


### Parameters:

- **Load Preset** (Push-button)
  Brings up the Preset Browser to browse all available presets for this effect.

- **Save Preset** (Push-button)
  Brings up the Preset Save dialog to save a preset for this effect.

- **Mocha Project** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  Brings up the Mocha window for tracking footage and generating masks.

- **Blur Mocha** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  Blurs the Mocha Mask by this amount before using. This can be used to soften the edges or quantization artifacts of the mask, and smooth out the time displacements.

- **Mocha Opacity** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 1)
  Controls the strength of the Mocha mask. Lower values reduce the intensity of the effect.

- **Invert Mocha** (Check-box, Default: off)
  If enabled, the black and white of the Mocha Mask are inverted before applying the effect.

- **Resize Mocha** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  Scales the Mocha Mask. 1.0 is the original size.

- **Resize Rel X** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  The relative horizontal size of the Mocha Mask.

- **Resize Rel Y** (Default: 1, Range: 0 to 2)
  The relative vertical size of the Mocha Mask.

- **Shift Mocha** (X & Y, Default: [0 0], Range: any)
  Offsets the position of the Mocha Mask.

- **Dilate Mocha** (Default: 0, Range: -100 to 100)
  Dilates or erodes the Mocha Mask by this pixel amount before using.

- **Dilation Quality** (Popup menu, Default: Fast)
  Selects whether Dilate Mocha adusts quickly in default Fast mode or looks better in High quality mode.
  - **Fast**: Dilate Mocha in Fast mode for quick adjustments.
  - **High**: Dilate Mocha in High quality mode for a better looking mask shape.

- **Bypass Mocha** (Check-box, Default: off)
  Ignore the Mocha Mask and apply the effect to the entire source clip.

- **Show Mocha Only** (Check-box, Default: off)
  Bypass the effect and show the Mocha Mask itself.

- **Combine Masks** (Popup menu, Default: Union)
  Determines how to combine the Mocha Mask and Input Mask when both are supplied to the effect.
  - **Union**: Uses the area covered by both masks together.
  - **Intersect**: Uses the area that overlaps between the two masks.
  - **Mocha Only**: Ignore the Input Mask and only use the
Mocha Mask.

- **Scramble Speed** (Default: 0.1, Range: any)
  How much scrambling to apply to each tile. Zero gives the original image.

- **Scramble Rel X** (Default: 1, Range: 0 or greater)
  Relative scramble amount in X. Set to zero to get only vertical scrambling.

- **Scramble Rel Y** (Default: 1, Range: 0 or greater)
  Relative scramble amount in Y. Set to zero to get only horizontal scrambling.

- **Tiles** (Default: 10, Range: 1 or greater)
  How many tiles across the image. Increase for many tiny tiles; decrease for a few large ones.

- **Tile Rel Width** (Default: 1, Range: 0.01 or greater)
  Scales the height of each tile.

- **Tile Rel Height** (Default: 1, Range: 0.01 or greater)
  Scales the width of each tile.

- **Tile Shift** (X & Y, Default: [0 0], Range: any)
  shifts the edges of the tiles in X and Y. This doesn't shift the contents of the tiles, just the boundaries. Animate for an interesting effect.

- **Rotate Warp Dir** (Default: 0, Range: any)
  Rotates the warping direction by this many degrees. Animate to rotate the tiles around for an interesting effect.

- **Z Dist** (Default: 1, Range: 0.01 or greater)
  Scales the distance of the image in each tile in or out from its center. Increase to zoom out, decrease to zoom in.

- **Seed** (Default: 0.123, Range: 0 or greater)
  Used to initialize the random number generator. The actual seed value is not significant, but different seeds give different results and the same value should give a repeatable result.

- **Wrap** (Popup menu, Default: No)
  Determines the method for accessing outside the borders of the source image.
  - **No**: gives black beyond the borders.
  - **Tile**: repeats a copy of the image.
  - **Reflect**: repeats a mirrored copy. Edges are often less
visible with this method.

- **Filter** (Check-box, Default: off)
  If enabled, the image is filtered when it is resampled smaller. This gives a better quality result when Z Dist is greater than 1. Has no effect when Z Dist is 1 or less.

- **Blur Matte** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  Blurs the Matte input by this amount before using. This can provide a smoother transition between the matted and unmatted areas. It has no effect unless the Matte input is provided.

- **Invert Matte** (Check-box, Default: off)
  If on, inverts the Matte input so the effect is applied to areas where the Matte is black instead of white. This has no effect unless the Matte input is provided.

- **Matte Use** (Popup menu, Default: Luma)
  Determines how the Matte input channels are used to make a monochrome matte.
  - **Luma**: the luminance of the RGB channels is used.
  - **Alpha**: only the Alpha channel is used.

- **Opacity** (Popup menu, Default: Normal)
  Determines the method used for dealing with opacity/transparency.
  - **All Opaque**: Use this option to render slightly faster when
the input image is fully opaque with no transparency (alpha=1).
  - **Normal**: Process opacity normally.
  - **As Premult**: Process as if the image is already in
premultiplied form (colors have been scaled by opacity). This option
also renders slightly faster than Normal mode, but the results will
also be in premultiplied form, which is sometimes less correct.
If your image has sharp color changes where the matte
channel also has sharp edges, you may get better results with Normal
mode.

- **Crop Input Parameters** (Default: 0, Range: 0 or greater)
  These 4 parameters, Crop Top , Crop Bottom , Crop Left, and Crop Right , allow selecting a rectangular subsection of the input image to be processed. If the Wrap parameters are set to "No" the exposed borders will be transparent. If the Wrap is "Tile" or "Reflect" the source image is wrapped on the new cropped borders to fill the frame. This can make it easier to avoid artifacts due to distorting an image with bad edges.
